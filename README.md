# NMPZ

Slop nmpz ctf platform I made in one night. You will need bun, uv and nona to run it. All python scripts are ran with `uv run <script>`. To get started, run `download_panoramas.py` followed by `cleanup_black_tiles.py` followed by `google_to_pannellum.py`. Then you can `bun install` and `bun dev`. To make your own challenges, you will need to start with `solutions.json` and `static/levels.json` containing the mandatory fields: `name`, `pano`, `lat`, `lng` and `t`, `resolution`, `threshold` respectively. All other fields are generated by build_ctf.ts. I will clean this up in time for next year's idekCTF... this year you're on your own.

Check out https://h3geo.org/ for a map of the tiling. PoW is Argon2d, configured with t parameter, runs in wasm. Crypto scheme uses SSS and AES to encrypt flag shares, making this chal fully self-hostable. OSM is used for the minimap and pannellum for the panorama.
